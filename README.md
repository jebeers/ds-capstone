# ds-capstone

This project exhibits my ability to do data science via a series of Jupyter notebook files.  The Applied Data Science Capstone course has students go through the process of collecting data, cleaning data, exploring data, visualizing data, and using machine learning to make predictions from the data.  The initial pushes to the repository will consist of the unedited, incomplete Jupyter notebooks as provided from IBM Skills Network; subsequent pushes will consist of my completion of the missing parts.

For those wondering why the principal branch is `master` instead of `main`, IBM Watson Studio does not yet support pushing to any branches other than the `master` branch.
